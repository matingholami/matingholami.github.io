      <description>why Don&amp;rsquo;t I just lorem them Ipsums? Many people do this, and it seems quite reasonable to put some Lorem ipsum at place as for test content to fill out blanks and show pros and cons of a design, right? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about that! I just don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of publishing something that is not but ctrl+c =&amp;gt; ctrl+v, especially because I have somehow convinced myself to commit to not removing anything of this blog after publishing.</description>

      <description>If you intend to know more about me or get in touch with me, have a look at My Website
 I love writing, I mean I love being heard but I love writing regardless of weather my writing is being read or not. I love writing as if it were some sort of calming my unfamiliar-with-peace mind. This &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo; blog of mine is supposed to be a semi-safe place for me to write, of everything and without a clear goal to be aimed at.</description>
