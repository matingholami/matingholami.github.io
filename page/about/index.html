<p>I love writing, I mean I love being heard but I love writing regardless of weather my writing is being read or not.
I love writing as if it were some sort of calming my unfamiliar-with-peace mind.
This &ldquo;<em>personal</em>&rdquo; blog of mine is supposed to be a semi-safe place for me to write, of everything and without a clear goal to be aimed at.
A place to just write and feel good about it, and maybe in a few years look back at its archive and be like &ldquo;<em><strong>wow, This dude is so not me</strong></em>&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="technical-properties-of-this-blog">Technical properties of this blog</h2>
<p>Well to be honest, I myself don&rsquo;t know much about the technicals! All I know is I installed this site generating app and the next thing I know I&rsquo;m writing some content.</p>
<p>The blog pages are created using a blog-aware static-site-generator called hugo (quite popular at the time of writing) and
are made available to public using Github Pages service.</p>
